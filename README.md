In this project, I learned how to write code that is easy to read, update, and reuse. The CRUD Python module I built in Project One helped me connect the dashboard in Project Two to the MongoDB database. This made things more organized and saved time because I didn’t have to rewrite code. I could also use this module in other projects that need database connections.

When solving problems as a computer science student, I break the task into smaller steps and think about what the user needs. For this project, I focused on what Grazioso Salvare asked for and made sure the dashboard worked the way they needed it to. This project was more like real-world work than some earlier ones, and it helped me practice building something useful. In the future, I’ll keep using clear planning and reusable code when making databases and apps.

Computer scientists build tools and systems that help people and businesses work better. My work on this project could help a company like Grazioso Salvare keep track of animal data more easily and make faster decisions. This kind of project can help organizations be more efficient and effective in their mission.
